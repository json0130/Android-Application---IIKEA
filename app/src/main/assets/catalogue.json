The contours of our chaise longue are characterised by two distinctive features: the first is the continuous line of the side design that unites the different parts (backrest, seat, armrest, footrest) in a single stroke, marking the elongated profile of the armchair in accordance with the Pontian principle.\nThe second detail is the radius of the angle between the seat and the backrest, which is identical to that of Ponti's precisely stated in the construction notes of the '53 Distex now issued by Molteni&C as D.153.1.

The stone is translucent, radiating a gentle, ethereal glow, with earthy black and brown markings often visible in the stone.
